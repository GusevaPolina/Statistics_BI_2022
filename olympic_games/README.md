# Olympic games 1896-2016. Statistics 

In this project, data about athletes are explored and some statistics are applied. The report in form of a `.ipynb` notebook is in the `report` folder.
> :heavy_exclamation_mark: Due to unknown to me reasons, my filter function cuts more data than is needed. Therefore, some answers could be different from the ultimate ones.

<br />

The dataset contains such parameters as:
  - athletes' credentials: `ID`, `name`;
  - their parameters: `Sex`, `Age`, `Height`, `Weight`;
  - associations they belong to: `Team`, `NOC`;
  - their kinds of sport and categories of competitions: `Sport`, `Event`;
  - and finally their success: `Medal`;
  - also, when and where games were: `Games`, `Year`, `Season`, `City`.

Some values are unknown `NaN`.

<br />

To run the script, upload all your tables into one folder. Please, be sure that all files have the same extension. Pass it without `.` (ex., `csv`) into the `combiner` function as well as a path to the folder at the task#1.
Please, find the test data in the `olympic_games/data/raw_data` folder in this depository.

<br />

**Conclusion**: the Olympics should implement way more strict policies to prevent child exploitation and gendered ageism towards women (age is statistically proven to be younger). :shipit:
